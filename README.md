#catch the player

This animation features a player-controlled character in the center of the screen, surrounded by bouncing balls. As the player moves using arrow keys, the balls are attracted towards the player. If the balls collide with each other, they push away to avoid overlapping. Every 60 frames, a new ball appears randomly on the screen, provided there are fewer than 30 balls. If the number of balls exceeds 30, a congratulatory message appears, and the animation ends. The player-controlled character and balls are rendered with images and colors, creating a dynamic and interactive visual experience.
